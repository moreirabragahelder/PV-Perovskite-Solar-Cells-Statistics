# PV-Perovskite-Solar-Cells-Statistics
Here, I create a sequence of plots analyzing various statistical parameters of perovskite solar cells' photovoltaic performance. The visualizations provide insights into key metrics, trends, and stability over time.
Explanation:

Script Overview

This script analyzes the degradation of key photovoltaic parameters in MAPI perovskite solar cells over time. The visualization provides insights into the stability of these cells by examining the following metrics:

   PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency) â€“ Measures how efficiently the solar cell converts sunlight into electricity.

   Voc (Open-Circuit Voltage) â€“ Represents the maximum voltage when no current flows.

  Jsc (Short-Circuit Current Density) â€“ Indicates the current generated under short-circuit conditions.

  FF (Fill Factor) â€“ A crucial efficiency parameter that describes the quality of the solar cell.

  Key Features of the Script

  Loading Data

  Reads a CSV file containing time-series measurements of PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF for MAPI perovskite solar cells.

  Plot Styling

  Uses Seaborn for visualization aesthetics.

  Applies the "ticks" style for a clean and professional look.

  Scatter Plot Visualization

  Displays PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF values as blue data points to show trends over time.

  Each parameter is plotted separately for better clarity.

  Error Bars

  Adds standard deviation error bars (black) to indicate variability in the data.

  Linear Regression Analysis

  Computes a red regression line for each parameter to visualize long-term trends.

  The slope of the regression line represents the degradation rate over time.

  Annotation

  Displays the degradation rate of PCE (and other parameters) as text inside the plot for quick reference.

  Optional Annotations

  Includes a commented-out section that, when enabled, labels individual data points with their exact values.

  Saving & Displaying the Plot

  Saves the final PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF plots as high-quality PNG files with transparent backgrounds.

  Displays the plots for immediate analysis.

  Output

  Prints the linear regression slope for each parameter, indicating the degradation trend over time.

 Purpose & Insights

 This script helps analyze the long-term stability of MAPI perovskite solar cells by tracking changes in PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF. By understanding degradation patterns, researchers can optimize materials and fabrication techniques to enhance solar cell  performance and durability.
